Data visualization is the process of understanding data better and gaining insights from it by placing it in a visual context. Data visualization has become one of the most sought after skills.  If you understand your data well, you will know what you have to do with it, to build a cutting edge machine learning model.  Because Data visualization presents analytics visually, it enables you to identify correlations, patterns and trends that would might be undetected without it. Data Science and Visualization are certain to change the corporate landscape over the next few years. Since Matplotlib is one of the most used python libraries for data visualization, we will explore in this post how you can use it to get the most out of your data.
